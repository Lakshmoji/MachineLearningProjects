# MachineLearningProjects

The focus is on analyzing world food prices, specifically targeting the developing regions of the world. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling to understand the dynamics of food prices and their determinants. Key highlights include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, unit conversions (e.g., grams to kilograms), and normalizing prices to USD for consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insightful visualizations and analysis to identify the frequency of countries in the dataset, unique food items, and the impact of various factors on food prices. This includes economic stability, production capabilities, cultural habits, seasonal impacts, and the relationship between commodities and their by-products.

Modeling: Implementing XGBoost for predicting food prices and evaluating model performance. Feature importance analysis is performed to identify the most significant predictors of food prices.

Insights and Recommendations: The analysis sheds light on the influence of economic conditions, fuel prices, production capabilities, cultural preferences, and seasonal variations on food prices. It also emphasizes the interconnectedness between the prices of commodities and their by-products.

Technical Implementation: Utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, GeoPandas for geographical data handling, XGBoost for machine learning, and Scikit-learn for model evaluation and feature importance analysis.

This comprehensive analysis offers valuable insights into the factors affecting food prices in developing countries, providing a foundation for developing strategies to mitigate risks associated with food price volatility.
